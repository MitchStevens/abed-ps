{- 
  piece add/rotate/remove
  Note that all of these operations can possibly fail and thus require the constraint:
    => MonadError BoardError m
  
  operations that don't modify the board only have the constraint: 
    => MonadState Board
  
  This means that the operation can never fail and re don't have to handle the error case.
  Very useful to seperate the board operations this way.
