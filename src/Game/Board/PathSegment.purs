  This function asks: Given a path segment and a possible extant piece, does there exist a piece that would combine the functionality of the path segment and the extant piece

  Generally when creating a path, if there is a piece already on the board overlapping one of the locations of the path, the path will not be created. However when the piece is a wire piece, we are *sometimes* able to accomedate the new path if the wire piece is compatible.

  Say there is a row of identity pieces from one end of the board to the other. If a path were created starting at the top and ending at the bottom, we could replace the middle piece with a cross-piece which would preserve the transmission of the signal from left to right.
