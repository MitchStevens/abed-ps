  EDGE QUERIES:

  Every piece has a number of ports, and we need to ask questions about these ports:
    - what is this port connected to?
    - what is the capacity of this port?
  
  We use a datatype called `AbsoluteEdge` to specify a particular port location on the board. An `AbsoluteEdge` is a `Location` and a `Direction`.  This is the way to reference ports from the perspective of the board.

  However, consider the perspective of a piece. If a piece has no rotation, it's `Left` input port is taking input from the `Left` port on the board. But when the piece is rotated clockwise by 90deg, the piece takes input from the absolute direction `Up`.

         U                         U      
    ┏━━━━━━━━━┓               ┏━━━━━━━━━┓  
    ┃    U    ┃               ┃    L    ┃  
   L┃ L     R ┃R     -->     L┃ D     U ┃R 
    ┃    D    ┃    rotate     ┃    R    ┃  
    ┗━━━━━━━━━┛    piece      ┗━━━━━━━━━┛  
         D         90 deg          D      

  Before the inputs are provided to the piece for eval, we need to translate between `AbsoluteEdge` and `RelativeEdge`. We do this with `toAbsoluteEdge` and `toRelativeEdge`
