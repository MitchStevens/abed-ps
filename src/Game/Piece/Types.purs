  what is a piece?
    a piece has at least 1 output (or else what the hell does it do?)
    a piece has at least 1 input
    a piece can be evaluated
    a piece has ports
    a piece has a unique identifier
    a piece might have a capacity, and if it does, this capacity should be modifiable

    When capacity of a port is changed, we want to do one of the following:
      - the capacity should change, and the capacity should ripple to adjacent pieces 
      - the capacity should change, but the capacity should *not* ripple
      - the capacity shouldn't change

    The `updatePort` function asks: if there was suddenly a `port` in the direction `dir`, how should the piece react?. In general we don't want the piece to do anything, but if the piece is a wire piece, it's desirable to add/remove output ports if a change in the matching port is detected.

    Maybe there's a piece like `add signals` which 

    HISTORY:
    We also need a way to tell if a piece changed after a port was updated. Originally `updatePort` had the type signature:
      `updatePort :: Piece p => CardinalDirection -> Maybe Port -> p -> p`
    
    
    Unfortunately, from this type signature there was no was to tell whether the piece was actually modified when a port was updated.

      The new type of `updatePort` is:
      `updatePort :: Piece p => CardinalDirection -> Maybe PortType -> p -> Maybe p`
    
    The function will now output `Just Piece` if the `Piece` was modified and `Nothing` if it's not modified. Also note that the `Maybe Port` parameter was changed to `Maybe PortType`, this was to ensure that `updatePort` cannot possibly change capacity (because the piece doesn't know what the adjacent port capacity is)

  {-
    To effeciently compile a board, we need to know whether a piece can be simplified. Since our `eval` function is non-symbolic, we need to encode this information into the piece type. 

      - constant pieces don't have to be evaluated, their values can be added to the initial signal map during compilation
      - connection pieces don't have to be evaluated either, their functionality can be added to the connection map during compilation
