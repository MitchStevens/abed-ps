--  , "the first piece 'id' (short for IDENTITY) takes a signal from the left and outputs the same signal to the right"
--  , "the second piece 'not' takes a signal from the left and negates it"
--  , "true become false, false becomes true"
--  , "double click 'id' to add an 'id' piece to the board"
--  , "... i assume you added the piece? i haven't integrated the chat feature with th board yet so i'm pretty blind lmao"
--  , "the empty circles represent input ports and the black circles are output ports"
--  , "click and the drag the piece to the locatin (2, 1). note that when you do this the message in the sidebar changes"
--  , "note that the sidebar message changes from 'You need an Input in the Left direction' after you move the piece" 
--  , "So now the sidebar says 'You need an Input in the Left direction'"
--  , "lets add another 'id' piece and move it to the left, remember double click!"
--  , "you should see some weird output in the sidebar, i haven't fixed this part yet"
--  , "i'll cut to the soluion; the puzzle is complete when you connect the left side to the right side with two 'not' pieces and an 'id' piece"
--  , "if you get 'failed predicate it's because you used too many 'id' pieces. you only need one!"
--  , "once you've completed the level, sidebar says 'problem complete'"
--  , "it's a little underwhelming for now"
--  , "ok that's the whole demo, big d out :)"
