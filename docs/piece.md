## updating ports
- when: a board is modified

```
get list of modified locations
update ports of adjacent locations
perform capacity ripple at location
finally, evaluate the board
```

### what about 




## how does is a wire capacity set?
    - can capacity be set only via input capacity?
    - if we set one wire, all the parents/children be set to the same capacity?
    - what about loops?
        - this is a gneeral question when updaing ports?
